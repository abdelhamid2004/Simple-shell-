## Features

- Supports basic shell commands such as `env', `ls`, and `exit`.
- Executes external programs.
- Handles signal interrupts (Ctrl+D).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-shell.git
```

2. Compile the code:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o shell
```

3. Run the shell:

```
./shell
```

## Usage

Once the shell is running, you can enter commands just like you would in a regular shell. The shell will parse and execute them accordingly.

## Command Examples

Here are some example commands you can try:

- `ls`: Lists the files in the current directory.
- `env`: provides you the environment.
- `cat filename`: Displays the contents of `filename`.
- `gcc filename.c -o output`: Compiles `filename.c` and generates an executable named `output`.
